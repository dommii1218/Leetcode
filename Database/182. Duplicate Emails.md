# 182. Duplicate Emails

Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.
```
+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
```
For example, your query should return the following for the above table:
```
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
```

# MySQL
```sql
SELECT Email
FROM Person
GROUP BY Email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```

**What's New:** 
```
SELECT column-names
FROM table-name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column-names
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column-names
```
