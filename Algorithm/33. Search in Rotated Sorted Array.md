# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```
**Hints: **
2 steps to solve this problem. Some tricky parts like `left < right` in the first loop while `left <= right` in the second loop (binary search).

## Python

```py
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        if not nums or len(nums) == 0:
            return -1
        
        left = 0
        right = len(nums)-1
        
        ## 1st step: to find pivot index
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if nums[mid] > nums[right]:  ##which is weird for sorted array [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
        pivot = left
        
        #2nd step: use shifted binary search
        left = 0
        right = len(nums)-1
        if nums[pivot] <= target <= nums[right]:
            left = pivot
        else:
            right = pivot
        
        ##start to use normal binary search
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif nums[mid] > target:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        
        return -1
```
