# 441. Arranging Coins

You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:
```
n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```
Example 2:
```
n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```

**Hints:**
Binary Search. 0<= k * (k + 1) / 2 <= n.

```
n = 5
*            k=1, kCoins = 1 = 1*(1+1)/2 contains 1
**           k=2, kCoins = 3 = 2*(2+1)/2 contains 2-3
**(*)        k=3, kCoins = 6 = 3*(3+1)/2 contains 4-6

left = 0; right = 5; k = 2; kCoins = 3; n = 5;
       3          5      4           10     5
       3          3      3           6      5
       3          2 (x)
```

## Java

**solution:**
```java
class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        long left = 0, right = n;
        while (left <= right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            long midCoins = mid * (mid + 1) / 2;
            if (midCoins == n) {
                return (int) mid;
            }
            else if (midCoins > n) {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
            else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return (int) right;
    }
}
```
