# 441. Arranging Coins

You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:
```
n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```
Example 2:
```
n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```

**Hints:**
Binary Search. 0<= k * (k + 1) / 2 <= n.

## Java

**solution:**
```java
class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        long left = 0, right = n;
        long k, kCoins;
        while (left <= right) {
            k = left + (right - left) / 2;
            kCoins = k * (k + 1) / 2;
            if (kCoins == n) return (int)k;
            else if (kCoins > n) right = k-1;
            else left = k+1;
        }
        return (int)right;    //return right since kCoins <= right, right is the upper bound
    }
}
```
