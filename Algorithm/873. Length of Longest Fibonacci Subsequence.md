# 873. Length of Longest Fibonacci Subsequence

A sequence `X_1, X_2, ..., X_n` is fibonacci-like if:

`n >= 3`
`X_i + X_{i+1} = X_{i+2} for all i + 2 <= n`
Given a strictly increasing array A of positive integers forming a sequence, find the length of the longest fibonacci-like subsequence of A.  If one does not exist, return 0.

(Recall that a subsequence is derived from another sequence A by deleting any number of elements (including none) from A, without changing the order of the remaining elements.  For example, [3, 5, 8] is a subsequence of [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].)

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,2,3,5,8].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,3,7,11,12,14,18]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like:
[1,11,12], [3,11,14] or [7,11,18].
```

**Hints:**

Dynamic Programming.<br>
space / T(n) = n^2<br>
Consider dp[i][j] for (i from 0 to n-1) and (j from 1 to n). Set all dp[i][j] = 2.<br>
For example, the array A = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], index of A = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7], store the relationship of number and index into HashMap.<br>
`Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();`<br>
`map.put(A[i],i);`<br>
For array [1,3], we can get the sum is 4. Store the dp from [1,3] to [3,4] because the length+=1. Thus dp[0][2] + 1 = dp[2][3].<br>
Find the optimal value in the whole dp matrix.

## Java
```java
class Solution {
    public int lenLongestFibSubseq(int[] A) {
        if (A == null || A.length < 3) return 0;
        
        int n = A.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++){
            map.put(A[i], i);
        }
        
        for (int i=0; i<n-1; i++) {
            for (int j=i+1; j<n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = 2;
            }
        }
        
        int max_len = 2;
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            for (int j=i+1; j<n; j++) {
                if (map.containsKey(A[i] + A[j])){
                    int k = map.get(A[i] + A[j]);
                    dp[j][k] = dp[i][j] + 1;
                    max_len = Math.max(max_len, dp[j][k]);
                }
            }
        }             
        return (max_len == 2) ? 0 : max_len;
    }
}
```
