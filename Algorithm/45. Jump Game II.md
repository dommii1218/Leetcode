# 45. Jump Game II

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

Example:
```
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.
    Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

**Hints:**

Backwards. Greedy.

Similar to Jump Game. From the end, to find the nearest position to the begining which can reach the current end. Then set the current end as the nearest position.

## Java
```java
class Solution {
    public int jump(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] maxPos = new int[n];
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            maxPos[i] = i+nums[i];
        }
        
        int step = 0;
        int currEnd = n-1;
        while (currEnd > 0) {
            for (int i=0; i<currEnd; i++) {
                if (maxPos[i] >= currEnd) {
                    currEnd = i;
                    step ++;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return step;
    }
}
```
