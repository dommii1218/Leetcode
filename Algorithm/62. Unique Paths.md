# 62. Unique Paths

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Example 1:
```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
```
Example 2:
```
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```

**Hints:**
Dynamic Programming.

## Java
```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int[][] opt = new int[m][n];
        for(int i=0; i<m; i++){
            for (int j=0; j<n; j++){
                if (i == 0 || j == 0) opt[i][j] = 1;
                else opt[i][j] = opt[i-1][j] + opt[i][j-1];
            }
        }
        return opt[m-1][n-1];
    }
}
```
